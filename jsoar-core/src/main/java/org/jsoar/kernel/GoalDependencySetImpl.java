/**
 * <em>This is an internal interface. Don't use it unless you know what you're doing.</em>
 *
 * <p>The Goal Dependency Set is a data structure used in Operand2 to maintain the integrity of a
 * subgoal with respect to changes in supergoal WMEs. Whenever a WME in the goal's dependency set
 * changes, the goal is immediately removed. The routines for maintaining the GDS and determining if
 * a goal should be retracted are in decide.c
 *
 * <p>Fields in a goal dependency set:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>goal:</b> points to the goal for which this dependency set was created. The goal also
 *       has a pointer back to the GDS.
 *   <li><b>wmes_in_gds:</b> A DLL of WMEs in the goal dependency set
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The GDS is created only when necessary; that is, when an o-supported WME is created in some
 * subgoal and that subgoal has no GDS already. The instantiations that led to the creation of the
 * o-supported WME are examined; any supergoal WMEs in these instantiations are added to the
 * wmes_in_gds DLL. The GDS for each goal is examined for every WM change; if a WME changes that is
 * on a GDS, the goal that the GDS points to is immediately removed.
 *
 * <p>When a goal is removed, the GDS is not immediately removed. Instead, whenever a WME is removed
 * (or when it is added to another GDS), we check to also make certain that its GDS has other WMEs
 * on the wmes_in_gds DLL. If not, then we remove the GDS then. This delay avoids having to scan
 * over all the WMEs in the GDS in addition to removing the goal (i.e., the maintenance cost is
 * amortized over a number of WM phases).
