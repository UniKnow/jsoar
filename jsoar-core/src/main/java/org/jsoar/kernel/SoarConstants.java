   * UNcomment the following line to have Soar maintain reference counts on wmes and prefs at the
   * top level. This can result in larger memory growth due to top-level objects that never get
   * deallocated because the ref counts never drop to 0. The default for Soar v6 - v8.6.1 was to
   * maintain the ref cts. It's possible that in your particular application, weird things could
   * happen if you don't do these ref cts, but if you are trying to improve performance and reduce
   * memory, it's worth testing your system with the top-level-ref-cts turned off. Soar will be much
   * more efficient. See comments in recmem.cpp
   *
   * <p>This value is controlled by the system property 'jsoar.do_top_level_ref_cts'. For example:
   *
   * <pre>
   * $ java -Djsoar.do_top_level_ref_cts=false ...
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>kernel.h:129:DO_TOP_LEVEL_REF_CTS (pre-processor macro defaults to <b>not defined</b> in
   * csoar)
   *
   * <p>Defaults to <code>false</code>
